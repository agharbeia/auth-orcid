# ORCID Sign-In

Using this module, is forked from auth-mastodon. It allows users can directly log in or register in HumHub using their ORCID credentials. 

A new button "ORCID" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please follow the [ORCID instructions](https://info.orcid.org/documentation/integration-guide/sign-in-using-orcid-credentials/) to create the required ` OAuth client ID` credentials.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> ORCID -> Settings`. 
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in the selected ORCID website's corresponding field.
